# "g" stands for "green", which means that the drawn curve is green, "-" means that the drawn curve is a solid line, which can be selected by yourself, and label represents the name of the legend. Generally, a u should be added in front of the name. If the name It is Chinese, it will not be displayed, and I donâ€™t know how to solve it yet.
